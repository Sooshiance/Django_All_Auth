This is a full authentication cycle project for Django AUTH with class based views from scratch

You have to fill up some settings in "settings.py", because we removed them for security reasons
and  if you want to know how to remove them you just need to install "python-decouple" module
and write this "from decouple import config" in "settings.py", after that you can use "config()"
method for any settings in your Django project like "SECRETE_KEY" or "DEBUG"

You can add "2-steps-Authentications" as you please.

If you found any bugs or better solution for class based views in this project,
send me a Comment.


Thanks!
